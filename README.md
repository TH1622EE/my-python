## Introduction

This repository contains code written for both project specific purposes, as well as a tutorial for my own reference and/or for anyone else who may find it useful. The code contained within this repository provides **NO** guarantee of functionality, and exists for the sole purpose of storing the source code for my application specific projects, and providing a general explanation of Python which correlates to my own development. Feel free to utilize the code contained within for your own purposes, but first review the repositories license file first. All projects are created as libraries and thus contained within and given a title consistent with the intention of the project/library. Contained within each project/library are modules (i.e., a collection of scripts) designed specific to the purpose of the project/library.
